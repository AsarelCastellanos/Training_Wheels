  <p>Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps. Hybrid apps are essentially small
    websites running in a browser shell in an app that have access to the native platform layer. Hybrid apps have many benefits
    over pure native apps, specifically in terms of platform support, speed of development, and access to 3rd party code.</p>
